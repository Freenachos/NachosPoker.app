It was my first experience with a coach and I've always been very skeptical about coaching in general, but after working with him I completely changed my mind. What impressed me the most was his empathy. One day I came to a lesson during a downswing and without me saying a word about it, he sensed something and said 'How about we have a mindset talk instead?' To me, that's an innate and truly essential quality in a coach. In about 13 months I went from being breakeven at NL50 to beating NL200, almost ready for NL500.",

      question: 'What is the structure of the mentorship program?',
      answer: `The mentorship program is structured to provide a comprehensive learning experience through a combination of personalized one-on-one coaching sessions, dynamic group sessions, and access to our exclusive high-stakes community. You'll receive individualized coaching, a full database review, and a personalized study plan tailored to your unique needs, along with homework assignments.

Additionally, you'll participate in weekly group sessions that foster a collaborative learning environment. In one-on-one sessions, we'll conduct a detailed analysis of your database using advanced tools to identify and address leaks, focusing on GTO range composition and exploiting areas of weakness to elevate your game.

The 3-month program consists of:
• 6 one-on-one coaching sessions (55 min)
• 13 group coaching sessions (55 min)
• Advanced database review`
    },
    {
      question: 'What skill level is the mentorship program best suited for?',
      answer: 'Our program is best suited for driven, motivated players who are eager to learn and take their game to the next level. While we tailor our coaching to each student\'s needs, those playing at mid-stakes or higher will gain the most from our data-driven strategies and advanced techniques. Ambitious low-stakes players ready to make a serious commitment to improvement are also welcome.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I receive any materials or resources to use after the program ends?',
      answer: 'Yes, you will have access to the resources provided during the program, including a personalized study plan and insights from your database review. Additionally, during the program you\'ll gain access to a comprehensive video database containing all past study sessions, presentations that break down complex concepts, and live-play videos. The strategies and concepts covered in both the one-on-one and group sessions are designed to be used and refined as you continue your poker journey.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a deadline for completing the one-on-one or group sessions?',
      answer: 'The one-on-one coaching sessions must be scheduled within the duration of your chosen package. Unused sessions will not be reimbursed. Unless otherwise agreed, you can book a maximum of one one-on-one coaching session per week. Any unused sessions will not carry over if you renew the program.\n\nThe 6-month program does include a one-time pause option, allowing for a break of up to two months.'
